    <h1>Internet</h1>
    <p>
      The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"
        >computer networks</a
      >
      that uses the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"
        >Internet protocol suite</a
      >
      (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network
      of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and
      government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of
      electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet
      carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the
      inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web
      (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United
      States Department of Defense funded research into time-sharing of
      computers.[15][16][17] Research into packet switching, one of the
      fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran in
      the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.[2][18] After
      the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching
      from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design for the
      ARPANET and other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and
      CYCLADES, which were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[
