      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine">machine</a> that can be
      programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
      (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of
      operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a
      wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that
      includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
      equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer
      to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
      computer network or computer cluster.
